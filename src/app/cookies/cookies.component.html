                <p>As is common practice with almost all professional websites this site uses cookies, which are tiny files that are
                   downloaded to your computer, to improve your experience. This page describes what information they gather, how I use it
                   and why I sometimes need to store these cookies. I will also share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored
                   however this may downgrade or 'break' certain elements of the sites functionality.</p>
